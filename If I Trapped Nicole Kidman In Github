We come to this place for magic. 
We come to AMC theaters to laugh, to cry, to care. 
Because we need that. All of us. 
That indescribable feeling we get when the lights begin to dim, and we go somewhere we never been before. Not just entertained but somehow reborn, together.
Dazzling images that on a huge silver screen. Sound that I can feel. Somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this.
Our heroes feel like the best part of us. And stories feel perfect and powerful because here... They are... AMC Theatres. We make movies better.
