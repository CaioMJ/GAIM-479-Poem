I spend my days confused by what I see around me
I blink my eyes and everything's changed
Up all night while my demons, they surround me
Gotta get my conscience rearranged

I need reminding every once in a while
I'm driving, c'mon, gimme the keys
Never gone too far to turn this thing around, hey
180 degrees

'Til I get back, hey, yes
Back to where my peace is strong
'Til I get back
Back to the place where my love belongs
